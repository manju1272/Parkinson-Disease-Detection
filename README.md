# Parkinson-Disease-Detection

 Parkinson's disease (PD) refers to a neurodegenerative illness with a variety of symptoms, including both
 motor and nonmotor ones, and no clear clinical sign for diagnosis. The most recognizable symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD)
 include stiffness, loss of postural reflexes, bradykinesia, and rest tremor. 

  A voice-based model exists for Parkinson's disease detection.This project
 describes the study of evolution of the essential aspects in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), with a focus on nonmotor symptoms and
 how they may be detected.

  Even now, one of the hardest things for doctors and research
 engineers to forecast is Parkinson's disease.In this project, we
 compared a number of machine learning algorithms for the prediction
 of Parkinson's disease. Among these, we identified the Decision Tree
 Classification model,XGBooster Classification model and Extra Tree
 Classification model with the best accuracy score of 98.3% followed
 by the Random Forest Classification model KNN Classification
 model with an accuracy score equal to 96.6%.
 Over all, speech processing holds great potential for the identification,
 classifying, and treatment of Parkinson's disease. We anticipate that
 more medical procedures and machine learning-based technologies
 will soon be accessible to help prevent this illness in people.
 Since audio data alone is insufficient as a biomarker for Parkinson's
 disease classification, we suggest using both audio and REM sleep
 data in the future to improve the results. Our results should promote
 the use of mobile recorded audio in telemedicine for the classification
 of Parkinson's disease
